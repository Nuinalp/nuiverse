## About

NUIverse is an BSD 3 Clause open source project under development. A progressive framework in javascript and modern css for building rich web interfaces based on Nuinalp Design.

He arose from the need to create web interfaces with great graphics capabilities of fast, easy, simple and you provide great possibilities of customization. Currently we have three sites:

-	[www.planiun.com.br](https://www.planiun.com.br) (a software download site)
-	[www.binarion.com](https://www.binarion.com.br) (teaching site and technology news)
-	[www.nuinalp.com](https://www.nuinalp.com) (our group's website/company)

Build these sites with pure CSS was a big job, we couldn't use Bootstrap on time and not in offers a great level of customization. Possessing shapes, colours and effects already defined, the only way to get what you really wanted to do was change the source code.

On this issue, we decided to create our own framework using our design language, the Nuinalp Design, assisting in our projects, mainly in the development of the [Pl√°nium OS](https://www.github.com/nuinalp/planium-os), our operating system.

With the NUIverse it will be possible to create web pages with a visual amazing, following our design language, but at the same time respect their standards, offering in this way numerous customization possibilities. In addition, you will be able to have a friendly and powerful front end, thus eliminating the need of using various javascript frameworks to build dynamic pages. With only two libraries, you will have everything you need to build any Web page in addition to enjoy advanced technologies and optimized :-).
